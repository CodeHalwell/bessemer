# Changelog

All notable changes to Bessemer are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (PEP 440 spelling for the Python
package). Detailed test evidence for each candidate lives in
[production readiness](docs/production-readiness.md) and
[qualification results](docs/qualification-results.md).

## [0.2.0a3] - 2026-11-04

First supervised application runtime. Python application routes run on the
Tier 2 bridge; the Tier 1 fast path and formal performance acceptance are open.

### Added

- Installable Rust/Python wheel with validated configuration and a supervised
  `bessemer` CLI (`run`, `routes`), resolving CLI flags, `BESSEMER_*`
  environment variables and `[tool.bessemer]` settings.
- `App`/`Router` registration with startup route and signature compilation:
  typed path, query, header, cookie and body inputs with constraints,
  dependency DAGs with per-request caching, app-scoped resources, sync, async
  and yield dependencies, and lifespan.
- JSON, text, HTML and redirect responses, repeated cookies, response models,
  filtered serialization, exception handlers, `Request`, state and
  request-scoped background tasks. Optional Pydantic 2.10.6+ validation.
- OpenAPI 3.1 generated once at startup, served natively, with optional docs.
- Native routing, JSON parsing and serialization, body and response limits,
  per-worker aggregate payload budgets, admission control, absolute processing
  deadlines and cancellation of queued sync work.
- Bounded HTTP/1 transport: connection, header-read, header count and buffer,
  and request-target limits with strict Host and framing checks.
- Re-exec worker supervisor sharing one listener, with readiness and event-loop
  heartbeats, cgroup CPU sizing, crash backoff, rolling reload, request,
  lifetime and RSS recycling, and TERM/drain/KILL shutdown with Linux
  process-group cleanup.
- Native CORS, environment-sourced API keys, allowed hosts, trusted proxy
  client IPs, rate limits, request IDs, security headers, protected Prometheus
  metrics and redacted access logs.
- Container image on pinned Debian Trixie with verified Tini as PID 1,
  qualified at 512 MiB and 256 MiB, plus an authenticated production example.
- Qualification tooling: installed-wheel HTTP and process-failure tests,
  seeded generated-input campaigns, extended soak and security scans.

### Known limitations

- Formal M0 performance acceptance is not met; local measurements were
  load-generator constrained and outside the 3% spread ceiling.
- The supervisor is POSIX-only; only Linux x86_64 with CPython 3.12 and 3.13
  is qualified.
- JWT/JWKS, distributed rate limiting, compression, streaming, WebSockets and
  OpenTelemetry are not implemented.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- M0 performance spike comparing an Axum JSON handler with a Rust-driven
  Python async handler, plus the paired benchmark harness.
